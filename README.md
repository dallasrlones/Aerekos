## Aerekos Generator

    Aerekos Generator is a program that generates code using the terminal.

## Aerekos Generator Goals

    Aerekos Generator plans on being able to generate a full stack and then
    modify it adding complete functionality without even writing a single line
    of code
    
## Aerekos is still being built

    Some things might not work fully, I'll be releasing updates every day
    so stay tuned for more

## Installation

```bash
    $npm install aerekos --save
```

## Using The Generator

    CD into Aerekos and then type node index.js --help
